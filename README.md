# basicAI
My journey creating some basic AI in a few languages. Since this is just the basics, I have combined a few different projects. If they get more complex, I'll make separate repos for those that take off.

## Mini-Projects (by language)
- Processing: building a genetic/evolutionary learning algorithm based on work from Code-Bullet ( https://youtu.be/BOZfhUcNiqk )
- Unity Engine: Replicating the genetic algorithm in unity engine because I don't want to use processing too much.
- .NET Core (C#): Building a neural network. Using C# because IntelliSense/Code is nice and I want to get used to it.
